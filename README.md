# About
This is a basic demo for a tabbed component using the Guardian Content API.

## How to
Install the node modules in your directory, then run `npm run build` to run the build scripts (babel and browserify), or `npm run start` to build then launch a local server.

## To-dos
Given more time, it would be a good idea to :
* Make the JS fully compatible with IE9.
* Improve the accessibility of the tabs handling so that they can be manipulated exclusively with the keyboard.
* Set up a proper task runner to handle the build scripts.
* Use a CSS preprocessor to split the CSS into more meaningful partials, use some nesting and add some doc.
* Improve the look & feel, particularly on mobile.
